Use jdk17

Save har file from chrome and generate RecordedSimulation.java file from it. Put that in the project in appropriate path.
(One RecordedSimulation.java is already for an LO user - use it or overwrite it).

Use ./bin/recorder.sh to run simulation from command line - one will be prompted for the simulation to be used and the flow.
